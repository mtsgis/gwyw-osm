Repo for my talk at NACIS 2013 Practical Cartography Day: "Getting what you want out of OpenStreetMap"

This will eventually include:

* A copy of the presentation
* [A list of useful OSM data converter links](https://github.com/pdxmele/gwyw-osm/blob/master/converters.md)
* Common OSM tag keys that you might want to use
* Probably some other stuff
