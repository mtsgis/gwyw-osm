##Getting what you want out of OpenStreetMap

A repo for my talk at [NACIS 2013](http://lanyrd.com/2013/nacis/) Practical Cartography Day on how to obtain and prepare OSM data for cartographic use

This repo will eventually include:

* [A copy of the presentation](https://github.com/pdxmele/gwyw-osm/raw/master/OSM_NACIS.pdf)
* [A list of useful OSM data converters](https://github.com/pdxmele/gwyw-osm/blob/master/converters.md)
* [Common OSM tag keys](https://github.com/pdxmele/gwyw-osm/blob/master/tags.md) that you might want to include in your downloads/conversions
* Probably some other stuff

Please feel free to make pull requests or open up issues with recommendations/additions/changes.
